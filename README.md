- 👋 Hi, I’m @DeclanBays
- 👀 I’m interested in all things Python, with a particular focus on research oriented software 
- 🌱 I’m currently looking to build a stronger knowledge of front-end development, as well as learn more advanced development methods in C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything that appeals to the above, or just piques an interest
